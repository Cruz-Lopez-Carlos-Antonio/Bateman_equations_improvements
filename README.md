### 1.1. Differential mass-balance equations. 
Bateman equations describe the time evolution of a set of nuclides in succesive transformations due to decay and transmutation process. These transformations can be represented by the following elementary structure:
$$X_1\buildrel\lambda_1\over\rightarrow X_2\buildrel\lambda_2\over\rightarrow\ldots\buildrel\lambda_{n-1}\over\rightarrow X_n\buildrel\lambda_n\over\rightarrow \tag{1}$$
where $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ are the concentration of the nuclides and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n$ are their decay constants. Structure given in Eq. (1) is known as a linear chain, and its time evolution can be modeled using the following set of coupled differential equations:

$$\frac{dX_i(t)}{dt}=\lambda_{i-1}X_{i-1}\left(t\right)-\lambda_{i}X_{i}(t), \tag{2}$$

with $\lambda_{i-1} X_{i-1}=0$ and $1\leq i\leq n$. 
### 1.2 Solution by Laplace transform. 
One of the most elementary ways to solve the system given in Eq.(2) consists of using the Laplace transform. For such task it is necessary to consider the following relationship:
$$\mathcal{L}\\{f^{(n)}(t),t\\}=s^n\mathcal{L} \\{f(t),t\\}-s^{n-1}f(0)-s^{n-2}f^\prime (0)-\ldots-f^{(n-1)}(0) \tag{3}.$$
Applying the last relationship to both sides of Eq. (2), the following system is obtained:

$$s{\widetilde{x}}_ i-X_i(0)=\lambda_{i-1}{\widetilde{x}}_{i-1}-\lambda_i{\widetilde{x}}_i \tag{4}$$

where ${\widetilde{x}}_ i$ and ${\widetilde{x}}_ {i-1}$ are the Laplace transforms of $X_i(t)$ and $X _ {i-1}$, respectively, and $X _ i(0)$ are the initial conditions. The system given in (4) can be rewritten as:
$${\widetilde{x}}_ i=\frac{\lambda_{i-1}{\widetilde{x}}_ {i-1}}{s+\lambda_i}+\frac{X_i\left(0\right)}{s+\lambda_i} \tag{5}$$
Considering the case where:
$$X_i (0)=0, \ i≥2 \tag{6},$$
the system given in Eq. (5) is reduced to:
$${\widetilde{x}}_ 1=\frac{X_1\left(0\right)}{s+\lambda_1},\ \ {\widetilde{x}}_ j=\frac{\lambda_{j-1}{\widetilde{x}}_{j-1}}{s+\lambda_j}. \tag{7}$$
with $j>=2$. After multiple replacement, it follows that:
