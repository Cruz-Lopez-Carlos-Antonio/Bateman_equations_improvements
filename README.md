# Bateman equations
The present repository contains a set of Python algorithms that improves the General Solution of the Bateman Equations, which were developed in the following article **"General Solution of Bateman Equations using Cauchy Products and the Theory of Divided Differences", which was submitted to the "Annals of Nuclear Energy" journal.

Mathematical and algorithmical generalities of the codes are described in the following lines with the purpose to provide some insight of the developed work. Nevertheless, a more detailed and precise discussion is provided in the submitted article.

## Financial Support.
The authors appreciate the financial support received from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, under the program “Estancias Posdoctorales por México, 2022”, with the project entitled: “Desarrollo de modelos fenomenológicos energéticos de orden fraccional, para la optimización y simulación en reactores nucleares de potencia”, by which the present development was possible.

## Software specifications.
The AnalyticNPKE codes were written in the Python programming language in its version 3. The codes require the following libraries:

- [x] itertools
- [x] numpy
- [x] decimal
